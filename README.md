# Cryptocurrency-Concoin-Blockchain

In this project, we have created a basic blockchain, and have improved it to built a cryptocurrency on top of it. 

We have then created the user interface (UI) which can be used to:
- Mine block
- Add transaction (given sender, receiver, amount)
- Add random transaction (for testing and development purpose)
- Verify blockchain
- View transactions in transaction pool
- View the entire blockchain.

## Directory structure

- Blockchain - In this part, we have implemented a basic blockchain, and have created a basic flask app to test the project.
- Cryptocurrency - In this part, we have improved upon our blockchain, then imported it as a module to create a cryptocurrency on top of it.

## How to run a node

Running a node is very straight forward:
1. Clone the project
2. cd to the cryptocurrency directory
3. Run 'python main.py'.
> Note that you may need to install the required libraries like Flask, hashlib and urllib.

## Tools, Languages and Frameworks used

- Python (The entire project is developed in python language)
- Flask (Used to develop the frontend part)
- Postman (For development and testing the routes).
